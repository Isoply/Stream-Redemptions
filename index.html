            You can start spinning the wheel by pressing the button on the wheel when you have segments on your wheel.<br>
            The images of the wheel can be changed by going into the folder and going to ".../Wheel/Images/" and in this folder add images called<br>
            "Button.png", "Pointer.png" and "Wheel.png"<br>

            If any of these do not exist, then that means you have not changed/added anything for it in the app.<br>

            When in the Random Loadout section, these are all your options:<br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            Framerate<br>&emsp;
            -The framerate at which this section runs.<br>
            Reward Name<br>&emsp;

            No Dupes<br>&emsp;
            -If selected, makes sure no item shows up twice.<br>
            Enable Queue<br>&emsp;
            -If enables, the first redeem will randomize your loadout, any future ones will pile up in a queue on the bottom right and can be clicked to use 1.<br>
            Clear Queue<br>&emsp;
            -Clears the current queue.
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">
            <br><img src="loadout options.JPG" ; alt="A display of how the loadout is roughly supposed to look like." width="384" height="216"><br>
            On the bottom right, where the queue also appears, there is always an invisible button to randomize your loadout.<br>
            All your loadouts get taken out of the folders, which are in ".../Loadout/Loadouts/".<br>
            <img src="loadout custom.JPG" ; alt="A display of where your text files go."><br>
            When you open loadouts for the first time, it will automatically make an example file for class based loadouts and regular loadouts.<br>
            Just name the file you're making to whatever you'd like, be it game or something else.<br>
            Any file for loadouts can follow this formatting:
            <section id="CodeSnippet">
                [Number of items to be pulled from this file]<br>
                item 1<br>
                item 2<br>
                item 3<br>
                ~ (This is an indicator of a new section, you can also add a number behind it if you want to take a different number from this secction than stated at the top.)<br>
                item 4<br>
                item 5<br>
                item 6<br>
            </section><br>
            <img src="loadout custom 2.JPG" ; alt="A display how a loadout file looks in the folder."><br>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">
            Anything incased in [] is something that should be replaced with what is stated inside.<br><br>
            For anything class based, you want to create a folder named after the game or something else.<br>
            Then inside you want to create text files for each class/individual loadout following the same previous formatting.<br>
            <img src="loadout custom 3.JPG" ; alt="A display how a loadout file looks in the folder for classes."><br><br>
            You can also change how the displayed loadout backgrounds look by changing the "Background.png" in ".../Loadout/Images/".<br>
            Or you can make a folder in ".../Loadout/Images/" with the game/something else name and put a "Background.png" in there for a specific game.<br>
            Also, in that same folder, you can add images with the same name as items to load the image beside the item like shown in a previous screenshot.<br>
            For any claass based folders like explained previously, you will also need to make class specific folders inside the game/something else folder.<br>
            Any save data is saved in the original loadout folder under ".../Loadout/Save.save".
